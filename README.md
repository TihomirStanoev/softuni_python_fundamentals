### **&nbsp;&nbsp;  🎓 About course**
With "Programming Fundamentals," students will begin to learn SoftUni's in-house curriculum for the comprehensive training of software engineers.
The course addresses fundamental concepts in programming that are the basis for effective and quality learning in the professional modules. Students 
will build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming techniques and structures such as: arrays,
